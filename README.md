# Kingdom Hearts DS Documentation Project
Documentation of the structure and contents of Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days and Kingdom Hearts Re:Coded for Nintendo DS. Any files are blank dummy files for demonstration purposes only. This repository contains no files from the games themselves.

Goal:
My goal is to provide clear documentation of the inner workings of the games to provide modders with a guide, that way they are not stumbling in the dark. It contains a recreation of the file sctructure. With lists of all files, and guides on how to mod certain aspects of the games. This documentation is very incomplete, and is a work in progress.
